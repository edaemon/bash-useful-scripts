#Useful bash scripts

This is a collection of some scripts that I've had occasion to use. They're not necessarily "good" or widely usable, but I've used them to get a job done here and there. They're collected here for my reference and safekeeping.

##Installation

To make these easier to use, I clone the repo (anywhere) and put the repo in my `PATH`. For example:

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/projects/bash-useful-scripts
```
